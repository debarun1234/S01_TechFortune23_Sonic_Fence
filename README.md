# Sonic Fence - Using Ultrasound to Keep Wildlife Away from Railway Tracks

## About
The Sonic Fence is an effective solution to the serious issue of train-animal accidents. It utilizes ultrasound sensors to detect trains and trigger ultrasounds to scare off animals from railway tracks. The Sonic Fence can reduce the number of accidents caused by these mishaps. This innovative and socially responsible solution can help protect wildlife and protect the wildlife ecosystem. 

## Problem Statement
Train-animal/humans accidents are serious and often fatal to both animals and humans. Conventional approaches like fencing and wildlife crossings are often costly, time consuming and may not be effective in preventing such events. The Sonic Fence project aims to address this issue by using ultrasound sensors to detect trains and scare off animals from railway tracks, thereby reducing the number of accidents caused by train-animal accidents.

## Solution
The Sonic Fence is a social innovation that uses ultrasound sensors to detect trains and scare off animals from railway tracks by various frequencies of sound. It employs an Arduino Nano, two HC-SR04 ultrasound sensors, a Piezo buzzer to detect the presence of trains and animals/humans. When a train is detected, the Piezo buzzer emits a high-pitched sound that scares away animals from the tracks. Once the train has passed, the sound stops. The second ultrasound sensor is used to detect the presence of animals/humans on the tracks. If an animal is detected, the Piezo buzzer is triggered to scare off the animal. This will help prevent future accidents. Hence by making use of these technologies, the Sonic Fence project stands out as an innovative and socially responsible solution to a pressing problem.

## Hardware and Software
* Hardware
  * Arduino Nano
  * HC-SR04 Ultrasound (x2)
  * Buzzer
  * LED
  * Mini Breadboard
  * Wires
* Software
  * Arduino IDE

## Working Procedure
* The Sonic Fence project uses two HC-SR04 ultrasound sensors to detect trains and animals.
* When a train is detected, the Arduino triggers the Piezo buzzer to emit a high-pitched sound, which helps to scare away animals from the tracks.
* Once the train has passed, the sound stops.
* The second ultrasound sensor is used to detect the presence of animals on the tracks.
* In case of detection, the Piezo buzzer is triggered to scare off the animal and keep the tracks clear.
